the knight from house payne beckoned for you to advance yelling, "come my
king, you can surely best me in an honorable duel to the death!" with a
grimace, you accept his request, and ready your weapon for the battle to
come. you now remember clearly who this knight is, none other than your most
trusted and valued dukes of your country. he is an exceptional duelist and
knows how to effectively carry out every military tactic known to man. you
prepare for the worst, assuming a defensive stance on top of the hill with 
your mighty weapon brandished, gleaming brightly in the mid summer day. 

do you buy your men enough time to evacuate the peasants and then evacuate
yourself, knowing your opponent might be too strong for you, or do you fight
it out to the death, confident in your strenghts as a skilled duelist and 
king of the land?

(fight or flight)
